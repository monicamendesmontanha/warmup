# Text Soup 3: The Final Chapter

Make a few modifications to the code from Text Soup 2 (make a copy, don't edit the version in the homework repo!), to cause the random words to be sourced dynamically via AJAX from Wikipedia, instead of from a hidden DIV already present in the HTML.

Your code should allow the user to specify a Wikipedia page name via a querystring field in the URL, such as index.html?page=Donald+Trump, whose contents will then be loaded via the Wikipedia API.

(SO is your friend, and so is Google.)
