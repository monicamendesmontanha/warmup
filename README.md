<h1>WARMUP</h1>
<h2>:computer: :thought_balloon:</h2>


Do warmups. The best way to start a programming's day, after a brekky, in my routine, is to spend 10-20 minutes solving some interesting challenge. Once I start coding I find it completely enjoyable and it actually keeps me focused and engaged along the day.
