/*
Badger's Revenge
The names of those who are witnessed clapping Badger more than twice in the first four days of any one week will go into a draw.
On Friday morning, a random name will be drawn from that list and the 'winner' will be forced to deliver the solution to Friday's warmup.

Create a program that Badger can use for this task - ideally, you should create an object (revengeOfBadger) to do this,
but if you can get it working using standalone functions, that's cool.

Your program should:

Track how many times each student in the class has clapped this week (just make up the numbers);
Include a collection of candidates for the Friday draw (ie, a list of names of people who have clapped Badger more than twice that week);
Pick a random student to deliver the solution to Friday's warmup.
If no one has clapped enough that week, the program should indicate that Badger has to do his own damned warmup.
